Small AI program I tampered around with. Here are the rules:
 - The game starts with n coins. You (the player) select the value of n at the start;
 - You (the player) may then remove as many coins as you want, but not all of them. Say you remove m coins;
 - The AI's turn begins, it may remove a maximum of 2m coins. Say it removes k coins;
 - Your turn begins, you may remove a maximum of 2k coins. The cycle continues;
 - The winner is the player who removes the final coin.

STUFF TO ADD:
 - Move stack (a printout at the end which enumerates all moves, will make fine-tuning AI easier);
 - Graphic interface (not urgent, for fun);
